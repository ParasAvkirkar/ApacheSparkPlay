Timing method for the Hadoop Task-2, Task-3 and Spark Task-1, Task-2

I used UNIX "time" command. (time <command to run>)
There are 3 components of the time command output: 

The Real time component represents actual time taken to complete the job
because it includes the time to complete hadoop job, log the status and response the result back.



Task to compute death counts for a given date range
Hadoop Task-2: 22.618 seconds
Spark Task-1: 6.502 seconds

The spark task had a better performance. It finish the task just in 6 seconds.


Task to compute cases per million
Hadoop Task-3: 22.471 seconds
Spark Task-2: 6.918 seconds

The spark task had a better performance. It finish the task just in roughly 6 seconds.
